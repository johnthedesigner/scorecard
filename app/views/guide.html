    <h1>Guide</h1>
    <h3>Summary View Page</h3><p>A separate table is provided for each of the five consumer segments and can be changed using the dropdown selection at the top of the page.</p>
    <p>Theme Ranking: The product themes for each consumer segment are ranked from top to bottom, best to worst according to overall positive sentiment.</p>
    <p>Comparison to the LEGO Average: This column tells the overall sentiment of this theme compared to overall sentiment of all other themes.</p>
    <p>Positive Drivers: The top two-three factors that Luminoso has identified as drivers of positive sentiment in this theme are shown ranked from left to right.</p>
    <p>Negative Drivers: Similarly, the top two-three factors that Luminoso has identified as drivers of negative sentiment in this theme are shown ranked from left to right.</p>
    
    <h3>On the LEGO Complete Scorecard Page</h3>
    <p>The topics on the left and the column headers are consistent across each monthly scorecard.</p>
    <p>Rows: Each row represents a possible topic that is discussed by reviewers. By hovering over a topic, you can see the keywords attributed to it and the percentage of all reviews with exact mentions of the keywords.</p>
    <p>Several topics (i.e. Education, Price, ----- ) have indented sub-topics below them that provide a deeper breakdown of the broader topic. The broad topic reveals any discussion about that topic, while the sub-topic precisely measures various sentiment or detail within that discussion.</p>
    <p>Columns: Columns provide understanding about the different experiences between the various groups of customers or toys. The “All LEGO” column represents all reviews of all products. The retailer columns represent which store the product was originally purchased at.</p>
    <p>By hovering over a column header, you can see certain quantitative information about the group: the total number of reviews to date, the percentage it makes up of all LEGO reviews, and a trendline for how the amount of reviews has changed month to month.</p>
    <p>Toggle button: Numerical values for the cells are not displayed by default. You can get a quicker, more intuitive understanding of the scorecard by using the colors-only view. Values can shown by clicking the “toggle button” in the top right.</p>
    <p>Colors: The shading of the cells tells how prominently a topic is being discussed in a given group. The colors range from white (low discussion volume) to dark blue (high discusion volume).</p>
    <p>Arrows: The arrows indicate that a notable change has occurred from the previous month.</p>
    <p>Values: The numerical values are directly related to the coloring of the cells. They indicate how often a given topic (row) is being discussed in the reviews by a given group (column). The values range from -1 to 1. The higher the number, the more discussion in that group about that topic.</p>
    <p>Values are most useful for viewing and comparing columns across one row (or topic). </p>
    <p>Average Star Rating: In the very last row, the average star rating of all reviews over time is given for each group.</p>
    
    <h3>On the Mega Bloks Complete Scorecard Page</h3>
    <p>Exact same as the text on the LEGO complete scorecard page, only with words switched from LEGO → Mega Bloks. Plus this one line at the top:</p>
    <p>This scorecard is designed and may be understood in the same way as the LEGO scorecard.</p>
